# Guitar-Multi-Effects

This was the final project for UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department Digital Signal Processing Senior Design Course 113DA in collaboration with Nicolas Vargas
The final project design was to emulate the usage of a modern guitar amp that would modify the signal input of the guitar. These modifications would be a standard amplification to output to a speaker as well as tremolo, distortion, and echo effects.
There were 2 variations of the project that accomplished the same goal, the first was using an electrical guitar as the source and the other was an acoustic guitar source.
These variations were due to remote learning being in effect and our remote locations limited on a unified source.
